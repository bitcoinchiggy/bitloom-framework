## 1. Grant of License
Licensor grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the **multisignature wallet descriptor files** identified in Exhibit A (the “Descriptors”).  

Each Descriptor represents a multisignature quorum (e.g., 2-of-3, 3-of-5) constructed from individual extended public keys (“XPUBs”).  
The assembly of XPUBs into Descriptor form is part of the licensed intangible property. It is not a service.

Licensee shall pay Licensor a flat royalty of **$[AMOUNT] per multisig quorum per year**, payable annually in advance.  

- Example: $200,000 per 2-of-3 quorum.  
- Fees are not contingent on Licensee’s net profits or income.  
- This Agreement covers only royalties for the right to use intangible property (the Descriptors).

All right, title, and interest in and to the Descriptors and associated XPUBs remain the sole property of Licensor.  
Licensee acquires no rights beyond the limited license granted herein.

---

## 4. Exclusion of Services
This Agreement covers only the license of Descriptors.  

It does not include wallet setup, monitoring, transaction management, node operation, or other services.  
If Licensee desires such services, they must be provided under a separate **Management Services Agreement** with a third-party provider.

---

## 5. Confidentiality
The Descriptors contain confidential and proprietary information.  
Licensee shall not disclose, sublicense, or distribute the Descriptors except as necessary for internal use.
