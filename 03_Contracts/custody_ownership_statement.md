**Bitloom LLC**

Effective Date: [DATE]  
Version: 1.0

---

## Purpose
This statement affirms the roles and responsibilities of Bitloom LLC (“Company”) and its employees with respect to Bitcoin custody in multisig wallet arrangements provided to client operating companies (“OpsCo”).

---

## Key Principles

1. **Client Ownership**  
   - OpsCo retains sole legal and beneficial ownership of all Bitcoin deposited to, withdrawn from, or otherwise controlled by multisig wallets licensed under contract with the Company.  
   - No rights, title, or interest in Bitcoin transfers to the Company or its employees.  

2. **Bitloom Role**  
   - The Company acts as a **technical coordinator** and **custodial agent** for specific keys assigned to employees.  
   - Employees (junior and senior technicians) safeguard keys, sign transactions only on instruction, and maintain logs as required.  

3. **No Unilateral Custody**  
   - Wallets are structured as **M-of-N multisig**, ensuring OpsCo always retains at least one key.  
   - This prevents the Company from moving funds unilaterally.  

4. **Policy Framework**  
   - Custodial activities are governed by the Company’s Key Management Policy, including logging, backup, rotation, and incident reporting.  
   - Employees acknowledge their duties under this policy as a condition of employment.
