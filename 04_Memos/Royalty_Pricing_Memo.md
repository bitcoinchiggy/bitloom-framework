# Royalty Pricing Memorandum  
*(XPUB and Multisig Licensing)*

**Purpose:**  
To substantiate the arm’s-length royalty rate charged for licensing extended public keys (XPUBs) and multisignature XPUB sets to an operating entity.  

---

## I. Background
- XPUB Creator Co generates and safeguards XPUBs.  
- Licensing Co assembles them into multisig quorums (2-of-3, 3-of-5, etc.) and licenses them to OpsCo.  
- OpsCo holds Bitcoin and requires multisig quorums to operate securely.  

Royalties for intangible property (XPUBs, multisig sets) qualify as **royalties under IRC §512(b)(2)** and are treated as IP income, not service income.

---

## II. Cost Basis
Direct and indirect costs include:  
- Hardware security modules, cold storage  
- Penetration testing, code audits  
- Legal and compliance costs  
- Governance, oversight, insurance  
- Employee wages for key-holders (~$15,000 each for 3–5 employees)

Estimated annual cost: **$50,000 per multisig quorum**.

## III. Royalty Rate Methodology
**A. Cost-Plus Approach**  
- Costs: $50,000  
- Risk & scarcity premium: 300–400%  
- Royalty: $150,000–$200,000 per quorum per year  

**B. Comparable Licensing Support**  
- Software/API licenses: $100k–$500k/year  
- IP royalties: 3–7% of gross revenues  

**C. Profit-Split Cross-Check**  
- If OpsCo earns $2M from Bitcoin wallet operations, 10% = $200k royalty.  
- Supports cost-plus outcome.

---

## IV. Segmentation
- **Creator Co → Licensing Co:** XPUB royalties (funds salaries).  
- **Licensing Co → OpsCo:** Multisig XPUB royalties (enterprise license).  
- **OpsCo → Management Co:** Management fees (services).  

---

## V. Conclusion
A royalty of **$200,000 per multisig quorum per year** is reasonable and defensible.  

This structure ensures:  
- IP royalties remain separated from service income.  
- Costs and employee wages are covered.  
- Market comparables support the rate.
