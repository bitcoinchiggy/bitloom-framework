## Purpose
This packet summarizes the policies, agreements, and memos that establish the legitimacy of wages paid to minor employees for their work as Key Custody & Signing Technicians. It is intended to provide contemporaneous documentation in the event of an IRS audit.

---

## 1. Compensation Rationale
- Wages are based on **reasonable compensation** standards, tied to industry analogues such as IT security assistants, wallet ops associates, and custody support staff.  
- Annual ranges: **\$8,000–\$14,000** depending on role and responsibilities.  
- Compensation is documented in the **Reasonable Compensation Memo**.  
- Wages are reported on W-2, not as gifts or disguised distributions.  
- Parent-owned LLC status avoids FICA tax on minor wages.  

---

## 2. Employment Documentation
- Signed **Employment Agreements** (junior & senior versions).  
- **Job Descriptions** detailing duties and supervisory roles.  
- Records of hours, training logs, and signing activities.  

---

## 3. Policy Framework
- **Key Management Policy** (with employee acknowledgment).  
- **Backup & Resiliency Appendix**.  
- **Logging Template** and completed logs (signing, backups, drills).  
- **Incident Report Template** and any filed reports.  
- **Annual Review Checklist** confirming compliance.  

---

## 4. Contracts & Client Arrangements
- **OpsCo License Agreement** establishing separation of ownership (OpsCo retains legal ownership of Bitcoin).  
- **Custody & Ownership Statement** confirming employees act as custodial agents only.  
- **Client Summary** provided to OpsCos for clarity.  

---

## 5. Supporting Evidence
- Logs of employee work (e.g., signing events, backup verifications).  
- Supervisor reviews of logs.  
- Resiliency drill outcomes.  
- Incident reports and resolutions.  
- Annual policy reviews and updates.

## 6. References

- IRS guidance on reasonable compensation.  

---

## Conclusion
The documents listed above demonstrate that:  
- Wages paid to minors are **reasonable, defensible, and tied to actual services rendered**.  
- Policies ensure security, accountability, and documentation of work.  
- Structures prevent any reclassification of wages as gifts or unearned income.  

This packet should be maintained and updated annually, with signed copies of agreements, logs, and memos stored securely in Company records.
