## Compensation Rationale

### 1. Industry Analogues
Comparable industry positions include:
- **Wallet Operations Associate** (crypto companies)  
- **IT Security Assistant** (entry-level)  
- **Custody Operations Support**  

Market wages for such roles (2024–2025) range from **$18–25/hour** at entry level.

### 2. Age & Training Adjustments
- Employees are minors working under parental supervision.  
- Duties are narrower in scope than full-time roles.  
- Adjustments made for part-time hours and developmental responsibilities.

### 3. Annual Wage Range
- **Junior Technician:** \$8,000 – \$12,000 per year.  
- **Senior Technician:** \$12,000 – \$14,000 per year.  

These levels are consistent with part-time work valued at \$10–\$15/hour for 8–12 hours/week during the year.

### 4. IRS Considerations
- Wages reflect **actual services performed**, not disguised gifts.  
- Payments are consistent with what an unrelated third party would reasonably pay for comparable duties.  
- Documentation (logs, incident reports, training checklists) supports the legitimacy of services rendered.  

---

## Conclusion
The Company has determined that annual wages in the range of **\$10,000–\$14,000** are reasonable for Key Custody & Signing Technicians, with higher wages justified for senior employees who carry supervisory responsibilities.

This memo should be retained in Company files and reviewed annually.
