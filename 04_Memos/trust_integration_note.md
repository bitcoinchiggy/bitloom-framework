# Trust & Estate Integration Note
**[COMPANY NAME]**

Effective Date: [DATE]  
Version: 1.0

---

## Purpose
This note provides guidance on how the Bitloom Framework may be integrated into family trust or estate planning structures. It is intended for internal planning and discussion with legal and tax advisors.

---

## 1. Trust Ownership of [COMPANY NAME]
- The parent-owned LLC (**[COMPANY NAME]**) can be transferred into a **revocable living trust** to ensure continuity of operations in the event of incapacity or death.  
- For irrevocable trust planning, ownership transfer may be considered for asset protection or estate tax purposes.  

---

## 2. Role of Minors as Employees
- Children can remain employees of the LLC even if ownership changes to a trust.  
- Employment Agreements, Compensation Memos, and Policies remain in effect.  
- Trustee (or successor manager) would supervise operations and enforce policy compliance.  

---

## 3. Multisig Custody and Trust Planning
- Trusts can hold an XPUB or key share directly, providing additional continuity.  
- Example: In a 2-of-3 multisig, the trust could be designated as one signer, with employees holding the other keys.  
- This ensures family continuity while preserving checks and balances.  

---

## 4. Coordination with Estate Plans
- Trust documents should reference:  
  - The **Custody & Ownership Statement** (OpsCo ownership of funds).  
  - The **Key Management Policy** (standards for custody and signing).  
  - The **Employment Agreements** (duties of children as custodians).  
- Integration ensures consistency between corporate governance and estate documents.  

---

## 5. Community Property Considerations
- In community property states, trust drafting should clarify whether [COMPANY NAME] is community property or separate property.  
- Proper classification helps preserve step-up in basis and minimize disputes.  

---

## 6. Professional Consultation
- All integrations should be reviewed by an estate planning attorney and CPA.  
- This note is **not legal or tax advice**; it provides a framework for discussion only.  

---

## Conclusion
The Bitloom Framework can be adapted into trust and estate planning by transferring ownership of [COMPANY NAME] into a trust and aligning multisig, employment, and custody arrangements with estate documents.  
This integration strengthens continuity and defensibility across both corporate and family governance.
