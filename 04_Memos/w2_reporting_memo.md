## Purpose
This memo documents how wages paid to minor employees of [COMPANY NAME] are reported for tax purposes. It is intended to demonstrate compliance with IRS requirements and provide defensibility in the event of an audit.

---

## 1. Employee Status
- Minor children are engaged as **W-2 employees**, not independent contractors.  
- Employment Agreements and Job Descriptions define duties as **Key Custody & Signing Technicians**.  
- Wages reflect **reasonable compensation** for services performed.  

---

## 2. Wage Reporting
- Wages are reported annually on **Form W-2**.  
- Wages are subject to **income tax withholding** (if applicable), but not to FICA (Social Security & Medicare) when both of the following are true:
  1. The LLC is a **disregarded entity** or partnership owned solely by the child’s parents.  
  2. The employees are the **parents’ children under age 18**.  
- IRS Source: IRS Publication 15 (Employer’s Tax Guide).  

---

## 3. Standard Deduction
- Minors benefit from the **standard deduction**, which typically offsets all or most of the reported wages.  
- In practice, wages up to the annual standard deduction limit are tax-free for income tax purposes.  

---

## 4. No Self-Employment Tax
- Because minors are classified as **employees**, their wages are not subject to self-employment tax.  
- Independent contractor arrangements would trigger self-employment tax; this is avoided by using W-2 classification.  

---

## 5. Supporting Documentation
- Signed Employment Agreements.  
- Reasonable Compensation Memo.  
- Job Descriptions.  
- Payroll records, logs of services performed, and annual W-2s.  

---

## Conclusion
This W-2 Reporting Memo demonstrates that [COMPANY NAME] correctly classifies and reports wages for minor employees, consistent with IRS rules.  
- Wages are defensible, reasonable, and documented.  
- No FICA taxes apply under IRS exemptions for family-owned businesses.  
- Reporting is handled through W-2 filings, ensuring compliance and transparency.
