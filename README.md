# Bitloom Framework

**Bitloom** (Bitcoin + heirloom) is an **open-source framework** for structuring family-owned entities (**[COMPANY NAME]**) to manage Bitcoin custody, multisig wallets, and intellectual property licensing — while compensating children in a tax-efficient and legally coherent way.

The project combines:
- Employment Agreements
- Key Management Policies
- License Agreements (multisig XPUB systems)
- Compensation Memos
- Operational Templates

Bitloom helps families securely manage keys, train the next generation, and build defensible business records for tax and regulatory purposes. It treats Bitcoin custody as a modern heirloom — something to be preserved, protected, and passed down.
