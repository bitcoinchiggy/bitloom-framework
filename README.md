# Bitloom Framework

**Bitloom** (Bitcoin + heirloom) is an **open-source framework** for structuring family-owned entities to manage Bitcoin custody, multisig wallets, and intellectual property licensing — while compensating children in a tax-efficient and legally coherent way.

The project combines:
- 📜 Employment Agreements
- 🔐 Key Management Policies
- 💼 License Agreements (multisig XPUB systems)
- 🧾 Compensation Memos
- 📊 Operational Templates

Bitloom helps families securely manage keys, train the next generation, and build defensible business records for tax and regulatory purposes. It treats Bitcoin custody as a *modern heirloom* — something to be preserved, protected, and passed down.
