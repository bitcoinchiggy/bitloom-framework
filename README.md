# Bitloom Framework

**Bitloom** (Bitcoin + heirloom) is an **open-source framework** for structuring family-owned entities to manage Bitcoin custody, multisig wallets, and intellectual property licensing — while compensating children in a tax-efficient and legally coherent way.

The project combines:
- 📜 **Employment Agreements** for family members as key custodians.  
- 🔐 **Key Management Policies** covering backups, rotation, resiliency, and incident response.  
- 💼 **License Agreements** for multisig XPUB systems licensed to operating companies.  
- 🧾 **Compensation Memos** documenting reasonable wages for minors performing real custodial duties.  
- 📊 **Operational Templates** for logging signing events, backup checks, and wallet recovery drills.  

Bitloom helps families **securely manage keys**, **train the next generation**, and **build defensible business records** for tax and regulatory purposes. It treats Bitcoin custody as a *modern heirloom* — something to be preserved, protected, and passed down.
