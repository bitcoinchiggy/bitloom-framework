## Project Name
Bitloom Framework (or substitute project name)

## Purpose
Parent-owned LLC (**[COMPANY NAME]**) employs children as key-custody technicians.  
- W-2 wages (earned income) avoid FICA when paid by a parent-only partnership/LLC.  
- Employees generate XPUBs, hold private keys as custodial agents, sign on request, and follow policy.  
- LLC combines XPUBs into multisig and licenses those multisig XPUBs to OpsCos.  
- OpsCos retain legal ownership of all Bitcoin; LLC coordinates wallets.  
- Employees are not owners; they are compensated for services.  

## Core Positions
- **Tax:** W-2 wages to minors ≈ tax-free under standard deduction; no FICA for parent-owned LLC; contractor/1099 income would incur SE tax.  
- **Legal:** XPUBs and derivations created in scope are Company IP; employees hold private keys as agents; custody avoids unilateral control by requiring OpsCo key.  
- **Ops:** Address issuance and UTXO hygiene are coordinated by the LLC; employees don’t generate addresses directly.  

## Style
- US English.  
- Plain-English explanations, professional but accessible.  
- Markdown outputs with clear `##` headings.  
- Copy-paste safe; no emojis.  

## Don’ts
- Do not provide legal/tax advice inside templates.  
- Do not assign private key ownership to the Company.  
- Do not let employees generate addresses directly.  

## Glossary
- **XPUB:** Extended public key, used to derive addresses.  
- **Custodian (Employee-Agent):** Holds keys as agent of the Company, without beneficial ownership.  
- **Multisig:** M-of-N wallet design; 2-of-3 recommended, with OpsCo retaining ≥1 key.
