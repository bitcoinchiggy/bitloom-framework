## Project name
Bitloom Framework

## Purpose
Parent-owned LLC employs children as key-custody technicians (earned income; no FICA for minors in parent-only partnership). Kids generate XPUBs, hold private keys as agents, sign on request, and follow policy. LLC combines XPUBs into multisig and licenses those multisig XPUBs to OpsCos. OpsCo owns the bitcoin; LLC coordinates wallets; kids are employees, not owners.

## Core positions
- Tax: W-2 wages to minors under standard deduction ≈ tax-free; no FICA if parent-only partnership; 1099 would incur SE tax.
- Legal: XPUBs/derivations created in scope are LLC IP; kids keep custodial possession of private keys as agents; avoid unilateral custody by ensuring client retains a key (e.g., 2-of-3).
- Ops: Address issuance/UTXO hygiene done by LLC; employees don’t generate addresses directly.

## Style
Markdown outputs, clear headings, U.S. terminology, concise.

## Don’ts
No legal/tax advice in templates; don’t assign private key ownership to LLC; employees don’t generate addresses.

## Glossary
XPUB, Custodian (employee-agent), Multisig (2-of-3 recommended with client key).
